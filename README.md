# storage
This is where I store completed codes and snippets I've written for later use and sharing. 
these are just some bits of code i wrote in my venture of teaching my self python. they all run pretty well, but could use improvements.  all of these i wrote on my own, the only ones i had a template or instructions for was myprogram2.py, and the filehandle.py, as they where part of my class at Udemy. if you make any changes or improvement,s please comment out the old code, but leave it, and add comments explaining what you changed and why.. WITH DETAILS. please.
